# TODO: 
## On Toy Model 1
 Batching almost done
 General number of vertex

## On Toy Model 2
 Move to multiple polygons case
 Decide on Input Done
 Decide on genus
 Do Splitting
 Do Merging instead of GENUS supervision
 Do RNN
 Think if other losses are needed
## Reward based sampling from buffer
## Check on eagle data

## On Toy Model 3
 Sanity check if extension works on 2d torus
